===========
That will be [CodeAndCoke](http://www.codeandcoke.com) website. Today, only a cool logo is shown there

My purpose is to make a website where people can learn to program with Java and other languages. Also, I will put some projects I have done
if I consider they are interesting to learn something

Now, I am testing [Vaadin](http://vaadin.com), a very interesting Java framework for building web applications
